# Flight Booking App

This is a flight booking app built using React. Users can search for flights by specifying the departure and arrival airports, departure date, return date (optional), and number of passengers. The app then displays a list of flights that match the search criteria, along with details such as price, duration, and layovers. Users can select a flight to view more details, and then book the flight by entering passenger information.
